Developed an 8-bit modular RTL-based Digital Event Monitoring Unit for real-time sensor monitoring with support for both signed and unsigned user-defined thresholds. Implemented a 3-state Moore Finite State Machine (IDLE, ALARM, COOLDOWN) to manage control logic, achieving operation up to 50 MHz with a 1-cycle alarm latency. Designed advanced diagnostic features including a Sticky Alarm latch and a Fault Capture Register to prevent transitory event loss and retain fault-triggering data. Verified functionality through extensive Cadence simulations and evaluated applications across industrial automation and healthcare domains aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals.
