# Design-of-a-Modular-Digital-Data-Monitoring-Unit
Developed an 8-bit modular RTL-based Digital Event Monitoring Unit for real-time sensor monitoring. Implemented a 3-state Moore FSM with 1-cycle alarm latency at 50 MHz. Added sticky alarm and fault capture features, verified through Cadence simulations for industrial and healthcare use cases.
