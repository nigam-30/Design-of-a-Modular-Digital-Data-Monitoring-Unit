Developed an 8-bit modular RTL-based Digital Event Monitoring Unit for real-time sensor monitoring with support for both signed and unsigned user-defined thresholds. Implemented a 3-state Moore Finite State Machine (IDLE, ALARM, COOLDOWN) to manage control logic, achieving operation up to 50 MHz with a 1-cycle alarm latency. Designed advanced diagnostic features including a Sticky Alarm latch and a Fault Capture Register to prevent transitory event loss and retain fault-triggering data. Verified functionality through extensive Cadence simulations and evaluated applications across industrial automation and healthcare domains aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals.

[RTL schematic view of the modular Digital Event Monitoring Unit designed in Verilog HDL.
The architecture integrates sensor and threshold registers, comparator logic, FSM-based control, alarm latch, and fault capture register to enable robust real-time monitoring.
The modular design improves scalability, reusability, and diagnostic capability for FPGA-based industrial and healthcare systems.] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1diK_dYo5Jqkw7fBFGjLXGGve9prxE2Km/view?usp=sharing)
